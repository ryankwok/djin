# Please write a unit test in pytest that satisfies the following requirements:
# a pyqt5 app that loads in a json and displays it in a tree view
# include this import at the top:
# from Specimens.{} import *
#
# 
# Content of your file is not specified, so I assume it's empty.
import pytest
from Specimens.my_file import *

@pytest.fixture
def main_window():
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
    app = QApplication([])
    return app

class TestMyApp:
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input,expected_output", [
        ("{}",
         "")]
    ])
    def test_load_json(self, main_window):
        # This is just a placeholder.
